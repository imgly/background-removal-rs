## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Simplified backend creation**: Replaced complex factory pattern with direct backend creation for improved performance and maintainability
- **Code quality improvements**: Fixed all clippy warnings in lib.rs and removed suppressions
- **API optimization**: `remove_background_from_image` now takes `&DynamicImage` instead of owned value for better performance
- **Async function cleanup**: Converted unnecessary async functions to sync for improved performance

### Removed
- **Backend factory abstraction**: Removed `BackendFactory` trait and `DefaultBackendFactory` implementation
- **Clippy suppressions**: Removed all `#![allow(clippy::...)]` directives from lib.rs after fixing underlying issues
- **WebAssembly support**: Removed WASM-specific conditional compilation and dependencies from Tract backend

### Added
- Consolidated imgly-bgremove library with unified API
- **Comprehensive tracing integration**: Migrated from `env_logger` to `tracing` ecosystem for structured logging
- **Tracing configuration module**: Centralized subscriber setup with support for console, JSON, and file outputs
- **Structured logging with spans**: Added hierarchical tracing to processing pipeline, model loading, and inference operations
- **Performance tracking spans**: Detailed timing and resource usage tracking with structured fields
- **Session correlation**: Automatic session ID generation for request correlation and debugging
- **Feature-gated tracing outputs**: Optional JSON logging, file appenders, and OpenTelemetry support
- **CLI tracing integration**: Maintains emoji-rich output while adding structured debugging capabilities
- **Simplified API**: `remove_background_from_reader` is now the primary function with 2-parameter signature
- **Unified configuration**: Model specification is now included in `RemovalConfig` for simplified usage
- **Format hint support**: Added optional format hint field to `RemovalConfig` for reader-based processing

### Changed  
- **BREAKING**: Simplified API to use `remove_background_from_reader(reader, config)` as primary function
- **BREAKING**: `RemovalConfig` now includes `model_spec` field for unified configuration
- **BREAKING**: `RemovalConfigBuilder` updated with `model_spec()` and `format_hint()` methods
- **BREAKING**: `remove_background_from_bytes(bytes, config)` now uses 2-parameter signature
- **BREAKING**: `remove_background_from_image(image, config)` now uses 2-parameter signature  
- **Default log level**: Set to ERROR for quiet operation by default (0=error, 1=warn, 2=info, 3=debug, 4+=trace)
- **Model selection messages**: Converted from println! to tracing::info! (only shown with -vv flag)

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `remove_background_with_model()` function - use `remove_background_from_reader()` instead
- **BREAKING**: Removed `remove_background_with_backend()` function - functionality merged into unified API
- **BREAKING**: Removed `remove_background_simple()` and `remove_background_simple_bytes()` functions - use `remove_background_from_reader()` or `remove_background_from_bytes()` instead
- **BREAKING**: Removed `remove_background_with_model_bytes()` function - use `remove_background_from_reader()` with `Cursor::new()`

bg-remove-onnx = "0.1.0"

bg-remove-core = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["embed-isnet-fp32"] }

# New feature configuration  
imgly-bgremove = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["embed-isnet-fp32"] }
# Or use default features for everything:
imgly-bgremove = "0.1.0"  # Includes onnx, tract, cli, embed-isnet-fp32
```

// Optional features for specific backends
#[cfg(feature = "onnx")]
let onnx_backend = OnnxBackend::new();

### Breaking Changes Summary

1. **Package Consolidation**: All workspace crates merged into single `imgly-bgremove` package
2. **Import Paths**: All `bg_remove_*` imports become `imgly_bgremove`
3. **CLI Binary**: `bg-remove-cli` becomes `imgly-bgremove`
4. **Feature Flags**: Backend and model features now configured on single crate
5. **API Changes**: Some internal APIs simplified and consolidated

### Backward Compatibility

- Core API functionality remains the same
- Same image processing capabilities and performance
- Same model support and configuration options
- Same execution providers and hardware acceleration
- Migration is primarily import path and dependency updates

- **Better Integration**: Tighter integration between backends and core functionality  
- **Easier Installation**: Single `imgly-bgremove` dependency with feature flags
- **Improved Documentation**: Unified documentation and examples
- **Better Testing**: Consolidated test suite and validation
- **Enhanced CLI**: Integrated CLI with all backends available by default
