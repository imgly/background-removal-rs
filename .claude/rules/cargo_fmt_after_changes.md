# Cargo Format After Changes

After each change to any Rust source file (*.rs), you MUST run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent code formatting.

If `cargo fmt` makes changes:
1. Review the formatting changes
2. Include the formatted code in your edits
3. Run `cargo fmt --check` to verify all files are properly formatted

This ensures code style consistency is maintained throughout the codebase.
