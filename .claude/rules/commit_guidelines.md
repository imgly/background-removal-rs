# Commit Guidelines
Always use conventional commits methodology for all git commits. Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc
- refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: adding missing tests
- chore: changes to build process or auxiliary tools
