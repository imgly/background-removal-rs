# SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle — each module or function should do one thing only.

Open-Closed Principle — software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle — derived classes must be substitutable for their base types.

Interface Segregation Principle — prefer many specific interfaces over one general-purpose interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle — depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
