# Feature Finalization Testing Rule

## MANDATORY: Test Implementation for All Features

Every feature implementation MUST be finalized with comprehensive testing to ensure functionality works correctly and doesn't break in the future.

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies to ALL feature development including:
- **New features or capabilities**
- **Bug fixes** that change behavior
- **API changes** or enhancements
- **CLI interface modifications**
- **Configuration changes** 
- **Performance improvements**
- **Refactoring** that could affect behavior

## Required Testing Types

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Test new functions/methods** added to the codebase
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Test input validation** and boundary conditions
- **Mock external dependencies** where appropriate
- **Achieve meaningful coverage** of new code paths

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Test feature end-to-end** with realistic scenarios
- **Test interaction** with existing features
- **Test CLI workflows** for CLI features
- **Test error handling** in integrated context
- **Verify expected behavior** matches specifications

### 3. Regression Tests
- **Ensure existing functionality** continues to work
- **Run full test suite** to catch regressions
- **Test backwards compatibility** where applicable
- **Verify no breaking changes** to public APIs

### 4. Manual Testing
- **Test actual user workflows** manually
- **Verify error messages** are helpful and accurate
- **Test edge cases** that are hard to unit test
- **Validate user experience** meets expectations

## Testing Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Test Planning (During Development)
```markdown
1. **Identify test scenarios** while implementing feature
2. **Document test cases** in implementation plan
3. **Write tests alongside code** (TDD when possible)
4. **Consider failure modes** and error paths
```

### Phase 2: Test Implementation (Before Feature Completion)
```markdown
1. **Write unit tests** for all new functions/methods
2. **Write integration tests** for feature workflows
3. **Add error condition tests** for robustness
4. **Update existing tests** if behavior changes
```

### Phase 3: Test Validation (Feature Finalization)
```markdown
1. **Run cargo test** - ensure all tests pass
2. **Run cargo check** - ensure code compiles
3. **Run cargo fmt** - ensure code formatting
4. **Manual testing** - verify real-world usage
5. **Regression testing** - ensure no breakage
```

### Phase 4: Test Documentation (Pre-Commit)
```markdown
1. **Document test coverage** in implementation plan
2. **Update test README** if new test patterns added
3. **Include test results** in feature validation
4. **Note any testing limitations** or future test needs
```

## Testing Standards

### Code Coverage
- **New code** should have meaningful test coverage
- **Critical paths** must be thoroughly tested
- **Error conditions** should be tested
- **Public APIs** must have comprehensive tests

### Test Quality
- **Tests should be deterministic** and not flaky
- **Tests should be fast** and efficient
- **Tests should be maintainable** and clear
- **Tests should test behavior**, not implementation details

### Test Organization
- **Group related tests** logically
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what's being tested
- **Include setup/teardown** for clean test environments
- **Use test utilities** and helpers to reduce duplication

## Enforcement and Validation

### Pre-Commit Requirements
Before any feature can be considered complete:
1. ✅ **All tests pass**: `cargo test` succeeds without failures
2. ✅ **Code quality**: `cargo check` and `cargo fmt` pass
3. ✅ **Benchmarks run**: `cargo bench` validates performance characteristics
4. ✅ **Manual validation**: Core workflows tested manually
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Test coverage documented in implementation plan

### Feature Review Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Unit tests written for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover user workflows  
- [ ] Error conditions and edge cases tested
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Benchmarks run successfully and document performance characteristics
- [ ] Manual testing performed and documented
- [ ] Test coverage documented in implementation plan
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and well-organized
- [ ] Performance impact analyzed and documented
```

### Testing Violations
**Serious Violation**: Completing a feature without proper testing because it:
- **Risks future regressions** when code changes
- **Reduces code quality** and reliability
- **Makes refactoring dangerous** without test safety net
- **Impacts user experience** through undetected bugs
- **Violates professional development standards**

## Testing Best Practices

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
When feasible, write tests before implementation:
1. **Write failing test** for desired behavior
2. **Implement minimal code** to make test pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** for next feature increment

### Test Categories by Feature Type

#### CLI Features
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_cli_flag_parsing() {
        // Test argument parsing
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_cli_workflow_success() {
        // Test successful command execution
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_cli_error_handling() {
        // Test error conditions and messages
    }
}
```

#### Cache Management Features
```rust
#[test]
fn test_cache_clear_specific_model() {
    // Test clearing individual models
}

#[test]
fn test_cache_clear_all_models() {
    // Test clearing entire cache
}

#[test]
fn test_custom_cache_directory() {
    // Test custom cache directory functionality
}
```

#### Model Processing Features
```rust
#[test]
fn test_model_download_and_cache() {
    // Test model download workflow
}

#[test]
fn test_model_processing_pipeline() {
    // Test end-to-end processing
}
```

### Integration Test Examples
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_full_cli_workflow() {
    // Test complete user workflow from CLI invocation to output
}

#[test]
fn test_error_recovery() {
    // Test system behavior when things go wrong
}
```

## Continuous Testing

### During Development
- **Run tests frequently** during development
- **Fix failing tests immediately** don't let them accumulate
- **Add tests for bugs** before fixing them
- **Consider test impact** when making changes

### Pre-Commit
- **Always run full test suite** before committing
- **Fix any test failures** before proceeding
- **Update tests** when behavior changes
- **Add tests for new functionality**

## Documentation Requirements

### Implementation Plan Updates
Document testing in implementation plan:
```markdown
## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: [X new tests covering Y functionality]
- Integration tests: [Z tests covering user workflows]
- Manual testing: [Scenarios tested and results]

### Test Results
- All tests passing: ✅
- Code coverage: [X% of new code covered]
- Manual validation: ✅ [Key workflows verified]

### Testing Limitations
- [Any areas not fully covered and why]
- [Future testing improvements needed]
```

## Summary

**Testing is not optional** - it's a fundamental requirement for feature completion. Every feature must be thoroughly tested before it can be considered finished. This ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and maintains user trust in the software.

**No feature is complete without tests** that verify it works correctly and will continue to work in the future.
