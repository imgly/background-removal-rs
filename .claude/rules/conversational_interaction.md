# Conversational Interaction

When asking questions, use a conversational form-based experience.

Ask each question individually prefixed with a character and  numbered answer options for quick selection.

Always include an "other" option that allows custom specification.

Format questions with clear numbering and an "Other (please specify)" choice.

This enables faster, more efficient user interactions through structured selection.
